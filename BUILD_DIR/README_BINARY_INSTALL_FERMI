The following is the step-by-step procedure to download and install
the binary version of the Fermi Science Tools:

Download the appropriate tarball from the website.

Unload the tarball in the directory where you would like the
software installed. The appropriate unix command is tar xvzf xxxxx,
where xxxxx is the name of the tarball. Thus if you run the tar
command from the 'software' directory, you will find a new
subdirectory with the tools and various auxillary files in the
'software' directory. The directory that is created will have the 
name ScienceTools-<version>, where version is a string that identifies
released version of the Fermi science tools. The following instructions 
are also found in a README_INSTALL file in this subdirectory. 



For the binary release you will need to:
     Unpack the tar file as described above.

go to the
      ScienceTools/<PLATFORM>>/BUILD_DIR directory:

      cd ScienceTools/<PLATFORM>/BUILD_DIR/

      where <PLATFORM> = e.g. "i686-apple-darwin8.11.1" or
      "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.3.4"

and run the main configure script, which will probe your system for
libraries, header files, compilers, etc., and then generate the main
Makefile.

To produce a default configuration, the configure script may simply be
invoked by (we recommend capturing the screen output from configure as
below):

./configure >& config.out & (C Shell variants)

./configure > config.out 2>&1 & (Bourne Shell variants)

to finish the installation.
If you don't know which shell you are using the command

echo $shell 

will show you the shell that you are running. 


     
Next set up the environment for your unix shell. In the following
cases replace the string <installed-directory> in the commands below
by the absolute path to the subdirectory created by unloading the
tarball.
          o For tcsh/csh, type:

            setenv FERMI_DIR <installed-directory>
            source $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.csh

          o For bash/sh, type:

            export FERMI_DIR=<installed-directory>
            source $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.sh

   Note: For MAC users running OSX 10.4 (Tiger) you will need to set an addtional 
         environment variable to run the science tools. This will mean
         that IDL cannot be run in the same window as the science tools.
   For C Shell variants

    setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES $FERMI_DIR/lib/libf2c.so

   or if you are using a version of the Bourne shell then 

    export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=$FERMI_DIR/lib/libf2c.so
    
    
In some cases the user may see an error message of the form

"dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib"

This is often the result of using a different package manager than the
one we have for our build system. Since the ScienceTools need some
external libraries (notably libfreetype).  You will need to install
these in some way.  We usually recommend a package manager (for Mac,
this would be MacPorts, Fink or HomeBrew).  Our development machines
use MacPorts or Fink and that defines the default locations that the
tools will look for libraries. If you have libfreetype installed
somewhere else you can just add the path to your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or
make a link from your location to /opt/local/lib/ . If you have trouble
with either of these check with your system administrator. You could
also install them from source if you prefer not to use a package
manager. 
    



After running these commands the FERMI science tools will be in
your path and all environment variables will be set as needed.

      The help files can be accessed in two ways 
          o by typing fhelp <tool>
          o Through the Reference Manual
