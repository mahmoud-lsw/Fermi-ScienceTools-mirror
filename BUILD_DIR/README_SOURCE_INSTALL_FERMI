Building the Fermi Science Tools from source code
-------------------------------------------------

0. You will need to make sure that your system has the development 
   packages available to build and link software. If you are unsure 
   about this please see your local system administrator or guru for
   additional guidance. 

1. Download the source code tarball from the FSSC Science Tools
website:

    http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/

This should give you a file with a name like:

    ScienceTools-<version>.tar.gz

The <version> string has the form:

    vVrRpP-fssc-YYYYMMDD

where:

    vVrRpP - V is the major version number, R is the release number,
    and P is the patch level.

    YYYYMMDD - Year (YYYY), month (MM), and day (DD) of the tool
    release.

2. Unpack the tarball in the directory where you would like the
software installed.

...
tar xvzf ScienceTools-<version>.tar.gz
...

You will find a new subdirectory named after the tarball, minus the
".tar.gz" suffix.

3. Move into the build directory.

...
cd ScienceTools-<version>/BUILD_DIR/
...

4. Run the configure script, which will probe your system for
libraries, header files, compilers, etc., and then generate the main
Makefile. To produce a default configuration, the configure script may
simply be invoked by:

...
./configure
...

We recommend capturing the output from configure as follows:

Using C Shell or variants, e.g. csh, tcsh:

...
./configure >& configure.out
...

Using Bourne shell or variants, e.g. sh, bash:

...
    ./configure > configure.out 2>&1
...

Do a quick scan through configure.out to see if there are any error
messages. They should be fairly obvious - any errors usually result in
the configure script aborting.

5. Run hmake to build the rest of the software:

...
./hmake
...

We recommend capturing the output from hmake as follows:

Using C Shell or variants, e.g. csh, tcsh:

...
./hmake >& hmake.out
...

Using Bourne shell or variants, e.g. sh, bash:

...
./hmake > hmake.out 2>&1
...

Check your hmake.out for errors! If a problem occurs and is discovered
at this point, it may be easy to correct (contact the help address:
fermihelp@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov). By contrast, if an error occurs,
but you continue with the next step, it may make resolving the problem
more complex or more time-consuming. See step 9 for what information
to include when contacting the help desk. 

The easiest way to check your build log for errors is to look for
occurrences of the string ***. (Most UNIX utilities which use regular
expression matching require these to be "escaped" using backslashes,
e.g. \*\*\*).

6. Run hmake to install the software:

...
./hmake install
...

It is useful to save the output from the hmake program:

In csh/tcsh:

...
./hmake install >& hmake_install.out
...

In sh/bash:

...
./hmake install > hmake_install.out 2>&1
...

7. Build and install the Science Tools test code:

...
./hmake test >& hmake_test.out
./hmake install-test >& install_test.out
...

8. Set up the environment for your Unix shell. In the commands below,
replace the string <installed-directory> by the absolute path to the
subdirectory created by unloading the tarball. The process of building
the software will create a platform-specific directory under the
<installed-directory> where <PLATFORM> can be several different
strings, e.g. "i686-apple-darwin8.11.1" or
"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.3.4"

For tcsh/csh, type:

...
setenv FERMI_DIR <installed-directory>/<PLATFORM>
source $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.csh
...

For bash/sh, type:

...
export FERMI_DIR=<installed-directory>/<PLATFORM>
source $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.sh
...

After running these commands the Fermi Science Tools will be in your
path and all environment variables will be set as needed.

To verify proper operation of the tools, run the test scripts that you
built and installed in Step 8. To do so, execute the following
commands in an empty testing directory:

...
ST-unit-test
ST-AGN-thread-test
ST-pulsar-test
...

Note: To run the ST-AGN-thread-test you must have the gll_iem_v05_rev1.fit diffuse background file in <installed-directory>/<PLATFORM>/refdata/fermi/galdiffuse.
The file can be obtained here: http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html 

The help files for individual tools can be accessed in two ways:

    * By typing fhelp <tool>
    * Through the Reference Manual

9. When contacting the Fermi help desk with an issue or problem
   in installing or building the Fermi science tools please include
   the following information
   a) The version of the operating system you are using e.g.
      Scientific Linux release 6.5 (Carbon)
      and
      uname -a
      Linux xxxxx 2.6.32-504.1.3.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Nov 11 14:19:04 CST 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

   b) The version of the compiler
      gcc --version
      gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4)

   c) the results of the env command e.g. 
      env > env.txt

   d) the log files captured in the configure and hmake steps.
