/** 
* \class ISpectrum
*
* \brief The virtual interface for Spectrum-type objects.
*
* Class for holding function definitions of Spectrums...
* an abstract base class.
*
* Notes: The input variable "time" means the
time when the event is called - that is, when the function flux(time1)
gets called, what should be returned is the flux (c/s/m^2/sr) for the
source at that time (time1), and/or when interval(time1) gets called, it
is asking for the interval between time1 and the time when the next
particle arrives.

However, using these finctions is tricky, since they seem to
contradict each other (i.e. "what happens if the flux at a certain time
is really low, but the interval to the next particle is really short?")
The answer lies in understanding which figure the FluxSvc code will use
to find the next particle, and it works this way:

1. FluxSvc will first call interval(time1) to find out when the next particle
comes. if this is a "good" (nonnegative) number, then this will be the
time when the next particle is understood to arrive.  If this is instead
a negative number (say -1), then the process will go to step 2:

2. FluxSvc will then call flux(time1) to determine the average flux for
that time, and then calculate the arrival time for the next particle using
the poisson distribution, as well as the solid angle of the source
(since flux is in units of c/s/m^2/sr.)

So, if interval(time) is set up to already know when the next particle will
arrive (this is necessary for sources with a high time-variance), then
FluxSvc will just use it, and otherwise, flux(time) will be used to
calculate the next time.
