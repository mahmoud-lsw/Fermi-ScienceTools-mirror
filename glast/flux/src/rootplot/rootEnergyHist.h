/** This class stores and graphs the flux vs.\ energy.
    Normal usage typically entails
    1. calling the constructor
    2. calling setTitle, setXLabel, setYLabel, etc.
    3. storing energies in the object using store
    4. calling apply to normalize the histogram
    5. calling draw or writeFile to output the results
