This code was imported into the HEASARC CVS repository on 13 August
2008. It was obtained from Giuseppe Romeo, as part of the code for his
PyPSF tool, which I will be working on in the future. The code was
copied (using the -r flag to preserve file modification dates) from:

/software/glast/gssc/local/orbit_simulator/ScienceTools-v7r6p1/GSSCUtils/v0/src/gtobspsf

After archiving the directory, I deleted temporary files in it, then
imported the code into CVS as follows:

...
export CVSROOT=":pserver:elwinter@daria:/glast"
cvs login
cvs import \
  -m "Import of code from Giuseppe Romeo, dated 24 April 2008." \
  ScienceTools/glast/gtobspsf \
  giuseppe \
  start
...

This puts Giuseppe's original code on a vendor branch in CVS, so we
can always get back to the starting point. All local changes will go
on the trunk.
