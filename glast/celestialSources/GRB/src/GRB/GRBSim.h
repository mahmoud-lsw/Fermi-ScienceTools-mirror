  \class GRBSim
  \brief Simulator engine of a GRB source.
  
  This class manages the GRB simulation.
  From the Parameters class (which contains the configuration): 
  -# It creates a GRBengine
  -# Gets the BATSE fluence (needed for flux normalization)
  -# Compute the Fireball spectrum, by adding the contribution of all the shocks (GRBShock) created by GRBengine class.
  (The spectrum is in units of [\f$ph/(m^2~s~keV)\f$] and it is computed as a function of time (sec) and energy (keV).
  -# Finally it normalizes the spectrum at BATSE energy: the observed BASTE fluence distribution is obtained.
  
  The GBM output is stored in a definition file, and in a GBM file, which contains the results of a "Band fit" every 16 ms.

    The name of the txt file is chosen in agreement with the GRB name (See GRBmanager).
