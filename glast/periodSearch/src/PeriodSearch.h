/** \class PeriodSearch
    \brief Base class for various statistical tests used to determine frequency of pulsation
           when an approximate frequency is known.

           Note on the units of time and frequency: This class does not assume a specific time unit. Instead, all
           times (both time series data and time durations) given to an object of this class must be in the same time
           units throughout the lifetime of the object, and all frequencies given to it must be in the units of the
           inverse of the time unit. All results from the object will be in the same units of time or frequency.
