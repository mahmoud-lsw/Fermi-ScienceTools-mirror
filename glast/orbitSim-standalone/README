This is a standalone release of the GLAST Science Tools gtorbsim
This version was derived from the source code
in ScienceTools v9r7p1 (with additional patches to bring it up 
to the latest GSSC version).

For help with each of these tools please see the
files gtorbsim.txt, in the help subdirectory.

To set up your environment to run these tools in tcsh/csh,
type:

  setenv ORBITSIMROOT <installed-directory>
  source $ORBITSIMROOT/orbSim-init.csh

but replace <installed-directory> with the absolute path to
the directory containing this README file.

To set up your environment to run these tools in bash/sh,
type:

  export ORBITSIMROOT=<installed-directory>
  source $ORBITSIMROOT/orbitSim-init.sh

but replace <installed-directory> with the absolute path to
the directory containing this README file.

Then both tools should be in your path and all environment
variables should be set as needed.

To run gtbin from the command line type:

$ gtorbsim

at your prompt ($ in the above example). To access the help files for 
these two tools simply use your favorite pager (e.g. cat, less, more) 

$ more $ORBITSIMROOT/help/gtorbsim.txt
