1. Checkout the latest cfitsio from the repository and make sure
you're setup to run Borland C++ or VC++.  You can't make a proper
dll/def file pair that will work with both Borland and VC++ using VC++
(I know, you're shocked :) and someone had problems using a Borland
library with VC++, so you've got to build separate libraries for
Borland and VC++ users.

2. 'del make.com'  or you can't type 'make' without trying to run this old
VMS relic. (relevant only for Borland)

3. 'make -f makefile.bc' for Borland and 'nmake -f makefile.vcc' for
VC++. This should generate cfitsio.def and cfitsio.dll, along the way
it will make windumpexts.exe to write the cfitsio.def file.

4. To wrap up the distribution, put the following files into a zip file.
You may want to rename Readme.win32 to README before putting it in the
distribution for consistency with past releases but whatever. 


cfitsio.def
cfitsio.dll
cfitsio.lib
fitsio.h
longnam.h
Readme.win32 -> README
testprog.c
testprog.std
testprog.tpt

5. Unzip your distribution to a temporary directory and build and run
the test program with VC++ and Borland to be sure it works.
 
    VC++:    cl testprog.c cfitsio.lib 
    BC++:    bcc32 -f testprog.c cfitsio.lib
