/*!\page releases Previous Release Notes

   Changes for CCfits 2.1 release Nov 2008
   - Modified several FITS constructors and FITS::open function to allow
   proper handling of CFITSIO <b>extended filename syntax</b>.
   - Extended filename syntax example added to cookbook.
   - Fix made to FITS::read function for case of missing EXTVER keyword when searching for
   HDU with extver > 1.
   - Removed inclusion of the internal-only CFITSIO fitsio2.h file from Column.cxx.  LONGLONG limits
   definitions are now found in fitsio.h. 

   Changes for CCfits 2.0 release Feb 2008
   Enhancements to CCfits:
   - <b>Checksum Capability:</b> 4 checksum related functions have been added to the HDU
   class, which now allows users to set and verify checksums directly from inside CCfits.
   - <b>Capturing Error Messages:</b> The FitsException base class now stores its output error message,
   and it can be retrieved from any of the exception subclass objects with a call to
   the new FitsException::message() function.
   - <b>Improved Keyword Handling:</b> New functions copyAllKeys, keywordCategories, and
   a second addKey function have been added to the HDU class.  The Keyword class 
   now offers a public setValue function to modify an existing keyword.  Also the class
   member documentation for keyword related functions has been upgraded and expanded.  
   - <b>Image Scaling:</b> In the HDU class (for instances of its PHDU and image ExtHDU subclasses),
    scale and zero set functions can now write BSCALE and
   BZERO keywords to the file.  A new suppressScaling function has been added to
   temporarily turn off scaling.  The ImageExt\<T\> class has also been added to the documentation.
   - <b>Miscellaneous New Functions:</b>Table::getRowsize() (submitted by Patrik Jonsson), Fits::fitsPointer(), 
   Column::parent().
   
   Bug Fixes:
   - FITS constructor in Write mode caused a segmentation fault when used on read-only files. (Reported by Gerard Zins)
   - Column write functions were not turning off NULL checking even when the nulval pointer
   was set to 0. (Reported by Gerard Zins)  
   - For the FITS constructor which takes an existing FITS object as an argument, when
   given the filename of an existing file (and without the '!' specifier), it places
   a new primary HDU in the first extension.  It shouldn't allow a write operation at
   all in this case.  (Reported by Andy Beardmore)
   - Some additional #include statements are needed for compilation on a test 
   version of g++4.3 (Reported by Aurelien Jarno)
   
   Backwards Compatibility Issues: 
   - The following documented public access member functions
   have now been removed or made protected/private.  As these functions were
   either never fully implemented or could not successfully be used from
   external code, it is hoped that these removals will not break any pre-existing code:   FITS::clone, HDU::setKeyWord, 
   the HDU::bitpix set function,  the Keyword class constructors.
   
   Changes for CCfits 1.8 release 10/07.
   - Fixes made to bugs in Column write and writeArrays functions which were
   preventing the writing of variable-width columns.  Also now allows
   writing to fixed-width columns with arrays that are shorter than the fixed width.
   - The HDU::readAllKeys() function will no longer throw if it is unable
   to read a particular keyword.  Instead it will skip it and move to the
   next keyword.  This was done primarily to prevent it from tripping
   on undefined keywords. 
   
   Changes for CCfits 1.7 release 6/07.   
   Fixes for the following bugs:
   - The FITS::copy function merely wrote the copied HDU to the file, but
   did not allow it to be accessed for further modifications within CCfits.
   - When reading compressed images, CCfits should use the ZBITPIX and
   ZNAXIS keywords rather than BITPIX and NAXIS.  (Fix is based on a 
   patch submitted by Patrik Jonsson.)
   - The BSCALE keyword was being ignored if the BZERO keyword didn't also
   exist.
   - Cases of out-of-scope usage of std::string's c_str() pointers, could 
   potentially cause crash. (Fix submitted by Jeremy Sanders.) 
   
   Changes for CCfits 1.6 release 11/06
   - Added capbility to write compressed images, including 6 new wrapper
   public functions in FITS class.
   - In FITS::addImage, corrected the logic which checks for a pre-existing
   image extension with the same version number.
   - CFITSIO 3.02 renamed fitsfile struct member rice_nbits to noise_nbits.
   Made corresponding change in copyFitsPtr function in FITSUtil.cxx.  As it
   stands, this makes this version of CCfits incompatible with earlier
   versions of CFITSIO
   - In FITS.h definition, removed both friend declarations of HDUCreator
   Make functions.  It seems neither function needs to be a friend, and one
   of them is actually private.  Some compilers don't allow this (report
   came from MS VisualC++ user).  
   - Bug fix in Make function of HDUCreator.cxx.  When creating a new
   ImageExt (and not the primary), it was only passing the version number
   along for float and double types.  This causes problems when there is
   more than 1 image extension with the same name, and it needs the version
   number to distinguish them.
   - A couple of bug fixes to the first/last/stride version of PHDU read
   image subset.  It was not passing the proper parameters to 
   fits_read_subset, and was not always correctly resizing the 
   internal m_image array.
