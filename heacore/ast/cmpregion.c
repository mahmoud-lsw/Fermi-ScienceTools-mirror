/*
*class++
*  Name:
*     CmpRegion

*  Purpose:
*     A combination of two regions within a single Frame

*  Constructor Function:
c     astCmpRegion
f     AST_CMPREGION

*  Description:
*     A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
*     Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex 
*     Region. This combination may be performed either a boolean 
*     AND operator or a boolean OR operator. If the AND operator is 
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is 
*     inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is 
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside 
*     either (or both) of its two component Regions. Other operators can
*     be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using 
*     them to construct a new CmpRegion.
*
*     The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
*     Frame, but it must be possible for the 
c     astConvert 
f     AST_CONVERT 
*     function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
*     reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
*     a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
*     with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
*     acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
*     these two systems, and consequently the 
c     astConvert 
f     AST_CONVERT 
*     function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
*     the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
*     of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the 
*     CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
*
*     Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
*     component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
*     complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
*     way.

*  Inheritance:
*     The CmpRegion class inherits from the Region class.

*  Attributes:
*     The CmpRegion class does not define any new attributes beyond those
*     which are applicable to all Regions.

*  Functions:
c     The CmpRegion class does not define any new functions beyond those
f     The CmpRegion class does not define any new routines beyond those
*     which are applicable to all Regions.

*  Purpose:

*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"

*  Description:

*     negated.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array in which to return the lower axis bounds
*        covered by the Region in the base Frame of the encapsulated
*        FrameSet. It should have at least as many elements as there are 
*        axes in the base Frame.
*     ubnd
*        Pointer to an array in which to return the upper axis bounds
*        covered by the Region in the base Frame of the encapsulated
*        FrameSet. It should have at least as many elements as there are 
*        axes in the base Frame.

*     naxes
*        The number of base Frame axes to select.
*     axes
*        An array holding the zero-based indices of the base Frame axes

*        should be applied, while a zero value requests the inverse
*        transformation.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed (output)
*        coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given, in which case a
*        new PointSet will be created by this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*     -  The number of coordinate values per point in the input PointSet must
*     match the number of coordinates for the CmpRegion being applied.
*     -  If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for sufficient
*     number of points and coordinate values per point to accommodate the
*     result. Any excess space will be ignored.

*  Type:

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "cmpregion.h"
c     AstCmpRegion *astCmpRegion( AstRegion *region1, AstRegion *region2, 
c                                 int oper, const char *options, ... )
f     RESULT = AST_CMPREGION( REGION1, REGION2, OPER, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new CmpRegion and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
*     Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex 
*     Region. This combination may be performed either a boolean 
*     AND operator or a boolean OR operator. If the AND operator is 
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is 
*     inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is 
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside 
*     either (or both) of its two component Regions. Other operators can
*     be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using 
*     them to construct a new CmpRegion.
*
*     The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
*     Frame, but it must be possible for the 
c     astConvert 
f     AST_CONVERT 
*     function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
*     reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
*     a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
*     with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
*     acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
*     these two systems, and consequently the 
c     astConvert 
f     AST_CONVERT 
*     function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
*     the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
*     of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the 
*     CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
*
*     Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
*     component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
*     complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
*     way.

*  Parameters:
c     region1
f     REGION1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the first component Region.
c     region2
f     REGION2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the second component Region. This Region will be
*        transformed into the coordinate Frame of the first region before 
*        use. An error will be reported if this is not possible.
c     oper
f     OPER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The boolean operator with which to combine the two Regions. This
*        must be one of the symbolic constants AST__AND or AST__OR.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new CmpRegion. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new CmpRegion. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astCmpRegion()
f     AST_CMPREGION = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:
*     - If one of the supplied Regions has an associated uncertainty,
*     that uncertainty will also be used for the returned CmpRegion.
*     If both supplied Regions have associated uncertainties, the
*     uncertainty associated with the first Region will be used for the 
*     returned CmpRegion.
*     - Deep copies are taken of the supplied Regions. This means that
*     any subsequent changes made to the component Regions using the 
*     supplied pointers will have no effect on the CmpRegion.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the external (public) interface to
*     the astCmpRegion constructor function. It returns an ID value
*     (instead of a true C pointer) to external users, and must be
*     provided because astCmpRegion_ has a variable argument list which
*     cannot be encapsulated in a macro (where this conversion would
*     otherwise occur).
*     - Because no checking or casting of arguments is performed
*     before the function is invoked, the "region1" and "region2" parameters
*     are of type (void *) and are converted from an ID value to a
*     pointer and validated within the function itself.
*     - The variable argument list also prevents this function from
*     invoking astCmpRegion_ directly, so it must be a re-implementation
*     of it in all respects, except for the conversions between IDs
*     and pointers on input/output of Objects.

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new CmpRegion object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to
*     accommodate the CmpRegion plus any additional data associated with the
*     derived class. It then initialises a CmpRegion structure at the start
*     of this memory. If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the
*     contents of a virtual function table for a CmpRegion at the start of
*     the memory passed via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the CmpRegion is to be initialised.
*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the CmpRegion data
*        (sizeof(CmpRegion)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a
*        value of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself
*        using the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the CmpRegion (plus derived class
*        data). This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is
*        given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the
*        CmpRegion structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not
*        required for allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the CmpRegion's virtual function table
*        is to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new CmpRegion.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the Object
*        astClass function).
*     region1
*        Pointer to the first Region.
*     region2
*        Pointer to the second Region.
*     oper
*        The boolean operator to use. Must be one of AST__AND or AST__OR.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:

*  Name:
*     astLoadCmpRegion

*  Purpose:
*     Load a CmpRegion.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"
*     AstCmpRegion *astLoadCmpRegion( void *mem, size_t size,
*                                     AstCmpRegionVtab *vtab, const char *name,
*                                     AstChannel *channel )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new CmpRegion using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     CmpRegion structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a CmpRegion at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.


*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the CmpRegion is to be
*        loaded.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        CmpRegion data (sizeof(CmpRegion)) plus any data used by derived
*        classes. If a value of NULL is given, this function will
*        allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the CmpRegion (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the CmpRegion structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstCmpRegion) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new CmpRegion. If this is NULL, a pointer to
*        the (static) virtual function table for the CmpRegion class is
*        used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "CmpRegion" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
