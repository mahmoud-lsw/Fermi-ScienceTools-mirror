*  Name:
*     astbad

*  Purpose:
*     Generate a string representing the AST__BAD value.

*  Type:
*     C program.

*  Description:
*     This program writes a string to standard output containing a
*     formatted decimal representation of the C double value
*     AST__BAD. This is intended for use in defining the AST__BAD
*     constant for use from languages other than C.
*
*     The value written should contain sufficient decimal digits so
*     that a routine that uses it to generate a value in another
*     language will produce exactly the same value as a C program
*     using the AST__BAD macro.

*  Arguments:
*     None.
